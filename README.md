   - "Borrowed" badge if it's not in the major scale
5. View the complete progression formula at the bottom
6. Use this to understand, communicate, or transpose your progressions

## Understanding the Modes

### Ionian (Major Scale)
The familiar major scale. Bright, happy, and stable. Characteristic chords: **I** and **IV**

### Dorian
Minor with a raised 6th. Jazzy, sophisticated, and slightly melancholic. Characteristic chords: **ii** and **IV**

### Phrygian
Minor with a lowered 2nd. Spanish/flamenco flavor, exotic and dark. Characteristic chords: **‚ô≠II** and **‚ô≠VI**

### Lydian
Major with a raised 4th. Dreamy, floating, and ethereal. Characteristic chords: **II** and **#iv¬∞**

### Mixolydian
Major with a lowered 7th. Bluesy, rock-oriented, and uplifting. Characteristic chords: **I7**, **‚ô≠VII**, and **v**

### Aeolian (Natural Minor)
The natural minor scale. Melancholic, sad, but stable. Characteristic chords: **‚ô≠VI** and **‚ô≠VII**

### Locrian
Diminished tonic. Unstable, dark, and tense. Rarely used for composition. Characteristic chords: **i¬∞** and **‚ô≠V**

## Music Theory Tips

### What are Characteristic Chords?
Characteristic chords are the chords that make each mode sound unique. They contain the notes that differ from the standard major or minor scale, giving the mode its distinctive flavor.

### How to Use This Tool for Composition

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Select the emotional quality you want (bright, dark, jazzy, etc.)
2. **Use Characteristic Chords**: Build progressions around the starred (‚òÖ) chords to establish the modal sound
3. **Experiment**: Try progressions using the non-characteristic chords while occasionally returning to the characteristic ones to maintain the modal feel
4. **Resolution**: Resolve to the tonic chord (first chord) of the mode for stability

### Example Progressions

**Dorian (jazzy minor)**:
- i - IV - i (characteristic chords emphasize Dorian)
- i - ii - IV - i

**Lydian (dreamy major)**:
- I - II - I (the II major chord is the Lydian signature)
- I - II - iii - I

**Mixolydian (rock/blues)**:
- I - ‚ô≠VII - I (classic rock sound)
- I - ‚ô≠VII - IV - I

## Chord Analyzer Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Your Key
You're working with: **C, F, G**
1. Select these chords in the Analyzer
2. Results show "‚úì Perfect Match" for: **C Ionian** (C major), **G Mixolydian**, **F Lydian**
3. "C Ionian" is typically the strongest match since C-F-G are I-IV-V in C major

### Example 2: Borrowed Chords
You're using: **C, A** (both major)
1. Select these chords
2. Results show "50% Match" for several keys:
   - **C Ionian** contains C but not A major (shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not in scale: A)
   - **A Ionian** contains A but not C major (shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not in scale: C)
3. This tells you you're using a borrowed chord or mixing keys
4. You can still see which key fits better based on your tonic

### Example 3: Modal Discovery
You're using: **Dm, G, Am, C**
1. Select these chords
2. Results show "‚úì Perfect Match" for: **C Ionian**, **D Dorian**, **G Mixolydian**
3. If you're emphasizing Dm, you're likely in **D Dorian**
4. The analyzer helps you see all valid interpretations

### Example 4: Finding Compatible Chords
You have: **Em, F, Bm**
1. Analyzer shows partial and perfect matches
2. Find a "‚úì Perfect Match" result like **E Phrygian**
3. Switch to Explorer tab and select that key/mode
4. Now you can see all available chords to add to your progression

## Progression Builder Examples

### Example 1: Classic Pop Progression
1. Go to "Progression" tab
2. Select: **C, Am, F, G**
3. Choose key: **C**
4. Result: **I - vi - IV - V** (the famous pop progression)

### Example 2: Understanding Borrowed Chords
1. Select: **C, Em, F, A**
2. Choose key: **C**
3. Result shows:
   - C = I
   - Em = iii
   - F = IV
   - A = VI (marked as "Borrowed" - this is from C minor/parallel borrowing)
4. Now you understand A is borrowed from C minor for color

### Example 3: Transposing Progressions
1. You know a song is: **I - IV - v - IV** in some key
2. You want to play it in **G**
3. Select key **G** in the Progression tab
4. Build G - C - Dm - C to match that formula
5. Or discover what chords make up that formula in any key
